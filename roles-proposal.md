# Answers to Hatchway Questions

## Question 1
1. What database changes would be required to the starter code to allow for different roles for authors of a blog post? Imagine that weâ€™d want to also be able to add custom roles and change the permission sets for certain roles on the fly without any code changes.


A: We'd need to make a new table for roles, where each entry had a role name, and permissions for that role. We would then need to add a new attribute / sql column to UserPosts
    definining a role for each UserPost. Since each UserPost can have multiple roles, and each role can be assigned to multiple UserPosts, this is a classic example of a "Many to Many" relationship. Thus I would add an integer ID to both UserPost and Roles and then create a new association table, "UserPostRoles" to describe the relationship between the two.
    To implement having at least one owner for each Post, we can either add an additional attribute to Posts counting the number of owners and
    updating this number every time an owner is added or removed from the post, or we could do a nested select statement of "post=PostID AND role=owner" to get the number of owners for each post.
    To add a custom role we would add a new entry to the role table. To change the permission set for a certain role, we'd just update the permission in the role table.

## Question 2
2. How would you have to change the PATCH route given your answer above to handle roles?


A: We would have to add role guards to check if the user has the correct role to modify the post. We would need to add a check for edit privileges for editing the blog post and a different check for being an owner to edit the authors list. Some edge cases would be having multiple roles with conflicting permissions. In that case, we should probably just check if the user has any of the roles that have the permission, and if so, allow the action.
    Other edge cases would be, deleting the last owner of a post. For deleting the last owner of a post, we should probably disallow the action and instead prompt the User to delete the post in front-end.
    For changes to the request body in the PATCH route, we would probably need to add an array of new roleID's for each user we want to edit the roles of, and most likely there userID as well (since we can have read only roles that won't appear in authorIds). We would also need to add a new attribute to the request body for the roleID of new roles we want to add to the post. This also creates some edge cases around adding invalid or non-existant roles or adding roles to users who don't exist. We can add explicit checks for these before modifying the database.
